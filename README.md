## üìò Overview

This assignment focuses on the implementation of basic deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras:

1. **Basic Autoencoder** - Image reconstruction using a dense autoencoder.
2. **Denoising Autoencoder** - Reconstruct clean images from noisy ones.
3. **Text Generation using RNN** - Character-based generation using LSTM.
4. **Sentiment Classification using RNN** - Sentiment prediction on the IMDB dataset using LSTM.
